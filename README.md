# Instacart-Python
This is a data analysis project for the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Course.
# Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has good sales, but they want to gain more insight on their sales patterns. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of products. My task as a data analyst is to perform an analysis of their data and help them answer key questions about their sales. For instance, I can inform them of the busiest days and hours so that they may adjust their scheduling of ads when there are fewer orders.
# Data
The data is open source data by Instacart from 2017.
